Contains aggregates from all state-level sources in one CSV.\n\n* **`output_files/states_all_extended.csv`**:\nThe contents of `states_all.csv` with additional data related to race and gender. \n\n\n### Column Breakdown\n\n#### **Identification**\n\n* `PRIMARY_KEY`: A combination of the year and state name.\n* `YEAR`\n* `STATE`\n\n\n#### **Enrollment**\nA breakdown of students enrolled in schools by school year.\n\n* `GRADES_PK`: Number of students in Pre-Kindergarten education.\n\n* `GRADES_4`: Number of students in fourth grade.\n\n* `GRADES_8`: Number of students in eighth grade.\n\n* `GRADES_12`: Number of students in twelfth grade.\n\n* `GRADES_1_8`: Number of students in the first through eighth grades.\n\n* `GRADES 9_12`: Number of students in the ninth through twelfth grades.\n\n* `GRADES_ALL`: The count of all students in the state. Comparable to ENROLL in the financial data (which is the U.S.\nCensus Bureau's estimate for students in the state).\n\nThe extended version of states_all contains additional columns that breakdown enrollment by race and gender. For example:\n\n* `G06_A_A`: Total number of sixth grade students.\n\n* `G06_AS_M`: Number of sixth grade male students whose ethnicity was classified as \"Asian\".\n\n* `G08_AS_A_READING`: Average reading score of eighth grade students whose ethnicity was classified as \"Asian\".\n\nThe represented races include AM (American Indian or Alaska Native), AS (Asian), HI (Hispanic/Latino), BL (Black or African American), WH (White), HP (Hawaiian Native/Pacific Islander), and TR (Two or More Races). The represented genders include M (Male) and F (Female).\n\n#### **Financials**\nA breakdown of states by revenue and expenditure.\n\n* `ENROLL`: The U.S. Census Bureau's count for students in the state.

The code (as well as additional project information) can be found [here][1].\n\n### Methodology Notes\n\n* Spreadsheets for NCES enrollment data for 2014, 2011, 2010, and 2009 \nwere modified to place key data on the same sheet, making scripting easier.\n\n* The column 'ENROLL' represents the U.S. Census Bureau data value (financial data), while the\ncolumn 'GRADES_ALL' represents the NCES data value (demographic data). Though the two organizations\ncorrespond on this matter, these values (which are ostensibly the same) do vary. Their documentation chalks this\nup to differences in membership (i.e. what is and is not a fourth grade student).\n\n* Enrollment data from NCES has seen a number of changes across survey years. One of the more notable is that data on student gender does not appear to have been collected until 2009. The information in states_all_extended.csv reflects this.\n\n* NAEP test score data is only available for certain years\n\n* The current version of this data is concerned with state-level patterns. It is the author's hope that future\nversions will allow for school district-level granularity.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nData is sourced from the U.S. Census Bureau and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES).\n\n### Licensing Notes\n\nThe licensing of these datasets state that it must not be used to identify specific students or schools.

So\ndon\u0027t do that.\n\n\n  [1]: https://github.com/justinrgarrard/USEduData","viewCount":128561,"downloadCount":14880,"scriptCount":26,"topicCount":3,"owner":{"id":1159129,"imageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-avatars/thumbnails/1159129-kg.png","name":"Roy Garrard","profileUrl":"/noriuk","slug":"noriuk","userTier":"CONTRIBUTOR"},"license":{"id":12,"name":"Other (specified in description)"},"overview":"K-12 financial, enrollment, and achievement data in one place","collaboratorList":{"owner":{"userId":1159129,"profileUrl":"/noriuk","thumbnailUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-avatars/thumbnails/1159129-kg.png","name":"Roy Garrard","slug":"noriuk","userTier":"CONTRIBUTOR","type":"OWNER"}},"coverImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-datasets-images/95317/222058/931f23cd121437c972b622a647c00b3c/dataset-cover.jpg?t=2018-12-22-16-03-27","data":{"totalSize":155201337,"isFileset":true,"canSeeDownload":true,"firestorePath":"LBHhyxtconPCuih0qjfW/versions/4lkjpYNFjnoYt7qiYey9","downloadUrl":"/datasets/noriuk/noriuk/download?datasetVersionNumber=5","versionId":1108572,"id":105442},"voteCount":428,"medalUrl":"/static/images/medals/datasets/silverl@2x.png","downloadUrl":"/datasets/noriuk/us-education-datasets-unification-project/download","lastUpdateTime":"2020-04-13T17:09:38.083Z","datasetVersionNumber":5,"creatorDisplayName":"Roy Garrard","cardImageUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-datasets-images/95317/222058/931f23cd121437c972b622a647c00b3c/dataset-card.jpg?t=2018-12-22-16-03-27","categories":{"tags":[{"id":12107,"name":"computer science","fullPath":"subject \u003E science and technology \u003E computer science","listingUrl":"/datasets?group=public\u0026tagids=12107","description":"There is one thing we can say for sure about computer science: Computer science leads to more computer games which leads to better GPUs which leads to smarter AI.","datasetCount":14887,"notebookCount":208,"tagUrl":"/tags/computer-science","displayName":"Computer Science"},{"id":11105,"name":"education","fullPath":"subject \u003E people and society \u003E education","listingUrl":"/datasets?group=public\u0026tagids=11105","description":"Education datasets and kernels relate to statistics on student performance, university rankings, and answers for all your homework questions.","datasetCount":9318,"competitionCount":5,"notebookCount":14688,"tagUrl":"/tags/education","displayName":"Education"},{"id":12125,"name":"programming","fullPath":"subject \u003E science and technology \u003E computer science \u003E programming","listingUrl":"/datasets?group=public\u0026tagids=12125","description":"The programming tag contains datsets and kernels from coder surveys, revision histories, and bug triaging.","datasetCount":4344,"notebookCount":86226,"tagUrl":"/tags/programming","displayName":"Programming"},{"id":11108,"name":"finance","fullPath":"subject \u003E people and society \u003E business \u003E finance","listingUrl":"/datasets?group=public\u0026tagids=11108","description":"The finance tag covers datasets and kernels about money and investing.
